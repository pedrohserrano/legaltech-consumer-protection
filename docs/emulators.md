## Emulators 

An emulator allows the user to run programmes that are built for another operating system than the one available on the user's device. To simulate that a user is working on a mobile phone or tablet when using a desktop or laptop, android or iOS emulators can be used. Many emulators are available. Some are paid, others are free. Some need to be downloaded, others run online. 
An easy to use online android emulator is [apkonline.net/free-android-online-emulator/run-android-online-emulator](https://www.apkonline.net/free-android-online-emulator/run-android-online-emulator). It can simulate:
* Phone calls
* Text messages
* Device location (GPS indication)
* Device rotation (Horizontal or vertical)
* Hardware sensors (Camera, touch pad, sound)
* Google Play Store

The disadvantage is that you are logged out when inactive for 60 seconds.
An iOS emulator that can be downloaded for free is Ipadian, available on: [filehorse.com/download-ipadian/](https://www.filehorse.com/download-ipadian/) For an instruction video on how to download it, see in [**this link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8mGht_N6MY)

In essence, an emulator allows the user to run programmes built for another operating system than the one available on the user's device.  The legality of emulators is accepted in the US. In the EU, the matter is still unsettled. Yet, it has been argued in legal scholarship that the creation of emulators for operating systems without the authorisation of the rightsholder of the operating system is permitted under the conditions of Article 6 of the Software Directive:
“where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of points (a) and (b) of Article 4(1) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided that the following conditions are met:
- (a)	those acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by a person authorised to do so;
- (b)	the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to the persons referred to in point (a); and
- (c)	those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary in order to achieve interoperability.

However, the information obtained is not:
- (a)	to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the independently created computer program;
- (b)	to be given to others, except when necessary for the interoperability of the independently created computer program; or
- (c)	to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar in its expression, or for any other act which infringes copyright”.
